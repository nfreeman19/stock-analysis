# stock-analysis
## Module 2

### Overview of Project:
The purpose of this is data workbook is to help steve Steve analyze the enrtire set of data. We are expanding the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. We refactored the first data sheet we made for Steve. We determined that refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster. We did not add any new functionality; we just made the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code. This made it easier for Steve to review and understand.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
