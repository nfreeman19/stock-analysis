# stock-analysis
## Module 2

### Overview of Project:
The purpose of this is data workbook is to help Steve analyze the enrtire set of data. We are expanding the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Hopefully this will help Steve read and understand the data better.

### Results:

The images above are the results after running 2017 and 2018.

Execution times were both very quick. 

As you can see from the postive numbers in ðŸŸ¢ and the negative numbers in ðŸ”´ the returns were better ad higher in 2017. Returns in 2018 we're mostly negative.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
We refactored the first data sheet we made for Steve. We determined that refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster. We did not add any new functionality; we just made the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code. This made it easier for Steve to review and understand.
